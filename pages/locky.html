            Where did it come from?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Locky ransomware was created by Necurs,
            <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/the-necurs-botnet-a-pandoras-box-of-malicious-spam/">
                one of the largest botnets in the world.
            </a>
            It's unclear who created the Flash exploit drive-by download,
            but they likely created it to spread the ransomware
            and earn more money through ransom payments.
