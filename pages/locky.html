            Where did it come from?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Locky ransomware was created by Necurs,
            <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/the-necurs-botnet-a-pandoras-box-of-malicious-spam/">
                one of the largest botnets in the world.
            </a>
            It's unclear who created the Flash exploit drive-by download,
            but they likely created it to spread the ransomware
            and earn more money through ransom payments.

                analysis
            </a>
            of researchers at FireEye,
            it was discovered that the Magnitude exploit kit
            targeted a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
            The vulnerability was then reported to Adobe
            and assigned the ID
            <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1019">
                CVE-2016-1019.
            </a>

        <h4 class="title is-4">
            Who/what does it target?
        </h4>
        <p>
            In general, Locky targets the
            <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/08/locky_ransomwaredis.html">
                healthcare industry.
            </a>
            However,
            it is unclear what types of companies or individuals that the Flash exploit drive-by download targets.
            Anyone using an outdated Flash player is at risk to it;
            however, this is not much of an issue currently because Flash is retired.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">
            How does it work?

        <h4 class="title is-4">
            What damage is it capable of doing?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Locky ransomware encrypts documents, pictures, and videos on a user's hard drive.
            Then, it sets the wallpaper to instructions for decrypting the files.
            Users are directed to visit a website and pay bitcoin to get the decryptor download.

            Has a fix been found? How can we defend ourselves?
        </h4>
        <p>
            A fix for CVE-2016-1019 has been found; Adobe
            <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa16-01.html">
                released the patch
            </a>
            in Flash Player 21.0.0.197.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, since Adobe Flash Player has been
            <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/700229/adobe-flash-is-dead%c2%a0heres-what-that-means/">
                retired,
            </a>
            there is nothing specific we must do to defend ourselves from this attack.
            Flash versions 32.0.0.387 onward
            <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/adobe-releases-final-flash-player-update-warns-of-2021-kill-switch/">
                do not function anymore,
            </a>
            so they cannot be exploited.
            However, to protect ourselves from similar attacks in the future,
            we must ensure that we keep our software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
