            <div class="question-answer-container">
                <p>Drive-by downloads are attacks designed to silently and automatically download and install malware or
                    other software onto a user's device. Usually made possible by exploits in browsers and their
                    plugins, drive-by downloads can have serious consequences, especially because many common antivirus
                    softwares are incapable of preventing them. A user is usually exposed to drive-by downloads via
                    popups and links in phishing emails. Generally, the aim of such an attack will be to utilize
                    vulnerabilities in web browsers, their plugins, and their extensions to take control of a client's
                    system or install and execute programs of the attacker's choice.</p>

            <h4 class="title">How do drive-by downloads work?</h4>

            <div class="question-answer-container">
                <p>This diagram demonstrates how a simplified drive-by download attack would occur. It begins with the
                    attacker creating a malicious website (potentially mimicking a legitimate website, like in a
                    phishing attack), which injects malicious code into its clients. When the client visits a legitimate
                    site, a signal is also sent out to an exploit site. In a sophisticated attack, several intermediate
                    websites will also be redirected to, making it harder to identify the exploit site. The exploit site
                    houses elaborate malicious code that searches for and takes advantages of exploits in the client's
                    current OS and web browser. If one is detected, it is utilized do install the malware of the
                    attacker's choice directly to the user's device, all without alerting the user of any unusual
                    activity.</p>
                <p>Another common form of drive-by downloads involves implanting hidden, malicious payloads into
                    authorized downloads. Such an attack involves some sort of attacker-created front for malware
                    delivery, which installs more than the user believes will be installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drive-by downloads may also be relatively non-malicious, installing adware or harmless PUPs
                    (potentially unwanted programs) onto the client's machine. However, most of our work on this project
                    is concentrated around the dangerous, malware-spreading usages of drive-by downloads.</p>
